ReactJS version of the original AdminLTE dashboard - https://github.com/almasaeed2010/AdminLTE


### UPDATES:

##### Widgets will use velocity.js animations instead of the originally used JQuery animations wherever possible, for improved performance across all browsers and devices.

More stuff coming soon. Stay tuned!


#### Instructions to run

- Fork or clone this repo
- Install nodejs and NPM
- Go to the project folder reactjs-adminlte from your terminal and run npm install
- Run node server.js
- Going to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) will render an empty dashboard skeleton in the client-side using ReactJS. Clicking on one of the dashboard options on the left pane displays the original dashboards from AdminLTE.
- Go to [http://localhost:8080/widgets.html](http://localhost:8080/widgets.html) to see available widgets in ReactJS.

This is still a work in progress and will get better over time. Will try and think of more essential features. Looking for contributions!

#### Upcoming stuff

- Re-usable chart components
- Command line options to choose between client-side rendering and server-side rendering in ReactJS
- Including D3 / C3 charts
