# ReactJS-AdminLTE

ReactJS version of the original AdminLTE dashboard - https://github.com/almasaeed2010/AdminLTE

####Instructions to run

- Fork or clone this repo
- Install nodejs and NPM
- Go to the project folder reactjs-adminlte from your terminal and run npm install
- Run node server.js
- Going to your localhost will render the dashboard in the client-side using ReactJS. Clicking on one of the dashboard options on the left pane displays the original dashboards from AdminLTE.

This is still a work in progress and will get better over time. Will try and think of more essential features.

####Upcoming stuff

- Re-usable chart components
- Command line options to choose between client-side rendering and server-side rendering in ReactJS
- Including D3 / C3 charts
